# Enunciated

The cupi2 foundation is conducting a campaign for education. The campaign
includes the sale of children's stories and all money received will be donated in
sales. You want to have an application that allows you to consult information on
the books for sale, buy a book and also see the progress of the sales.

For each book the following information will be handled: Name,
number of pages, price, number of units that have been sold and
the image on the cover.
The information for each book is loaded from a text file.
The application must:

1. Show the detailed information of a book
2. Allow the user to browse through all the children's story books.  That is to say,
go back and forth between the books, go to the first book and go to the last book.
If the user tries to go backwards, finding himself in the first book, the
must display a message informing you of what happened. Likewise, if the user tries to
advance, being in the last book, the application must show the message
respective.
3. Allow the user to search for a book by name and display its information. If the
book does not exist, the application must inform the user.
4. Allow the user to buy a book. 
5. Show the information of the best-selling book. If there is more than one book that meets
with that condition, the book with the highest price is shown.
6. Show the information of the collection achieved so far. 

Below are the features of the interface and some messages. 

# Interface

The interface presents the information of the book selected by the user,
the best-selling book information and the collection information. If no
book has been sold, the interface does not show information related to the
best-selling book.
